# **App Name**: MediVault

## Core Features:

- Document Upload: Allow users to digitally store their medical information by uploading medical documents such as lab reports, prescriptions, vaccination records, and scans (X-ray, MRI, etc.) via phone camera, files from phone storage (PDF, JPG, PNG), or direct upload by hospitals via admin panel. Users can also add metadata tagging by selecting document type (e.g., Prescription, Blood Test) and adding doctor’s name, date of issue, hospital/clinic name.
- Record Timeline: Organize health history in an easy-to-navigate timeline with chronological display of all uploaded documents and a visual timeline view. Users can filter and sort by date (latest, oldest), document type (e.g., Lab, Prescription, Vaccination), and hospital/clinic.
- Secure Sharing: Simplify and secure how patients share records with doctors by providing each user with a unique username/ID and generating a QR Code for quick sharing at hospitals. Temporary Access Codes / OTPs are available for limited-time access. Patients have controls to grant or revoke access at any time and view access logs (when and who accessed the data).
- Hospital Admin Panel (Web Portal): Hospitals and clinics can use a secure web portal to manage patient data. They can search patient by username or QR code, upload new documents directly into the patient’s record, view full medical history of the patient, and add doctor notes with uploaded files.
- Notifications & Updates: Keep users updated on their medical interactions with push notifications for new document uploads by hospital, access granted/denied confirmations, and record viewed by healthcare provider. Email or in-app alerts for follow-up reminders and vaccination/medication schedules.
- Data Security & Privacy: Ensure trust and compliance with end-to-end encryption for all user data, role-based access for hospital staff (admin, doctor, lab tech), no third-party data sharing, compliance with standard data protection laws (e.g., HIPAA/GDPR-ready), and local storage + cloud backup (optional toggle).
- Smart Insights (Future Scope): Help users make sense of their medical history with auto-categorization of records using AI, visual summaries (e.g., Blood pressure trend), and health reminders based on document type (e.g., annual tests).
