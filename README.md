🏥 MedVault
A simple and secure cloud-based platform for storing medical reports — like a DigiLocker for your health records.

📌 Overview
MedVault is a front-end web application designed to help individuals and healthcare providers store, access, and manage medical records securely. Patients can upload and organize their medical reports, while hospitals or doctors can easily access patient history when needed.

This project was initially built during a Design Thinking Workshop at my college. Since then, I’ve made improvements and deployed it live using Vercel.
